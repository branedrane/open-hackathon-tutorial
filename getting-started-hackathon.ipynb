    "- To apply for a power-up (before 5:00 PM ET, February 22), explain briefly what you intend to use it for. The relevant power-up sponsor will assess the applications and decide who to give them to! Note that this is **different** from the application for power-ups associated with coding challenges (due by 5PM ET today). Both can be used in the hackathon!\n",

    "### 2.2. How to come up with a project\n",
    "\n",
    "QHack provides you with a few useful resources to help generate project ideas:\n",
    "- The official description of the hackathon topics, coming out tomorrow morning at 10 AM ET.\n",
    "- Sponsor demos, particularly from sponsors associated with hackathon topics (they will be judging!).\n",
    "- Speaker sessions, since many speakers have explicitly suggested hackathon topics!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some other concrete (QHack- and PennyLane-oriented!) suggestions. Note that these will need to be associated with one of the hackathon topics, which will be more or less broad in scope:\n",
    "- Implement an idea from the quantum literature â€” or from one of our guest speaker presentations â€” with code.\n",
    "- Create a self-contained tutorial or demonstration of an idea from quantum computing. See the [PennyLane Community page](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos_community.html) to see what we're looking for!\n",
    "- Extend one of the QHack Coding Challenges in a novel or interesting way.\n",
    "- Repurpose one of the [PennyLane demos](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demonstrations.html) to run on a quantum hardware device.\n",
    "- Submit a Pull Request to an open-source library with a new feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of places besides QHack to find ideas! For instance, you could look at recent papers which provide a big-picture overview and/or discuss open problems, e.g. [\"Opportunities and Challenges in Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15844) or [\"Is quantum advantage the right goal for quantum machine learning?\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01340).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a good meta-heuristic: brainstorm! Sit down (virtually or otherwise) with your team members, chew over the available material, discuss everyone's interests and backgrounds, spend some team generating ideas individually then bring them together and see what happens. You may find patterns, overlaps, or ways to merge ideas that are unexpected!"

    "### 2.3. How to collaborate\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaboration is a big topic, so I'll just limit myself to a few tips:\n",
    "- *Communicate.* Find a channel for chatting (Discord, Slack, WhatsApp, ...) that is lightweight and searchable. You can use it to coordinate and stay in touch. When you communicate, try to be clear, timely and responsive. You will be working together intensively!\n",
    "- *Be nice.* Good collaboration is not just about what you say, but the way you say it! Be civil, respectful, and try to give constructive feedback. You are going to build something! (Note that QHack participants must abide by the [Code of Conduct](https://qhack.ai/code-of-conduct). If you feel harassed, threatened, or unsafe, **please contact us on Discord or Slack immediately**.)\n",
    "- *Agree on a division of labour.* Aim to be clear about who is doing what, when, as early as possible. You don't want to duplicate effort, or have an important part of the project stall because someone was meant to do something but didn't know it! Of course, things change; that's part of the hackathon rollercoaster. Clear, timely, and responsive communication are your friends in trying to adapt quickly to changes in project direction or scope.\n",
    "- *Use GitHub.* To complement the lightweight channel you use for coordination, you need version control software for the project itself. Since the final project is in the form of a GitHub repository, you may as well use it from the get go! If you're not familiar with GitHub, you can get started with their [Hello World tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world)."

    "### 2.4. How to hack\n",
    "\n",
    "A good hackathon project is as much art as science. Here are some correspondingly qualitative guidelines:\n",
    "- *Be ambitious, but not too ambitious.* The goal is to do something new that excites you and, with luck, the judges. That will probably mean tackling a hard problem! But bear in mind that you will have a limited number of person hours to do it. It may help to budget these out based on an initial assessment of the scope of the project and the number of people in your team.\n",
    "- *Be ready to pivot.* Sometimes things don't work out. Don't worry! It doesn't mean effort is wasted. Try to be flexible and creative with the things that have worked out, and find ways to recycle that code base, successful hardware runs, or a new model you trained. Apply them to a new and more achievable end.\n",
    "- *Be thrifty.* A hackathon project should focus on solving a \"top-level\" problem rather than all the lower-level subproblems. You are unlikely to have time to solve them all! Find existing solutions you can leverage â€” a GitHub repo, a paper, an optimization routine, even another hackathon project â€” and cobble them together.\n",
    "- *Be messy, but not too messy.* You have a week to build something awesome and new. If it doesn't have a few rough edges, you have probably spent too much time polishing! That said, you will be judged on presentation, so the goal and scope of your project, and the progress you have made towards it, should be clear. Focus on these \"frontend\" aspects of the presentation and not, say, commenting every line of code or optimizing something the judges will never see.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it from me. Please drop any questions into the thread, and happy QHacking!"
